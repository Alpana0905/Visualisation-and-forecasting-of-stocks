# Visualisation-and-forecasting-of-stocks
Team members: Alpana Singh, Muskan Samantaray, Soma

 Description : 
The Stock Exchange or Wall Street traders regularly research, evaluate, and follow the stock values of various firms' shares. These charts make it simpler for traders to visualise the behaviour of equities and forecast trends. But what if we could use these statistics to forecast the future stock price for a certain date?
In this project, we used some Machine Learning models which displayed company information (logo, registered name, and description), and some stock plots based on the stock code given by the user. Also the ML model enabled the user to get predicted stock prices for the user input.
